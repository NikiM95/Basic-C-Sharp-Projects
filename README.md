# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

# Projects:
* **MethodClassAssignment**
* **AbstractClassAssignment**
* **OperatorsAssignment**
* **CodeFirstAssignment**

**MethodClassAssignment**

This repository contains a simple C# console application demonstrating a class with a method for performing mathematical operations on integers.
The MathOperations class contains a method named PerformOperation which takes two integers as parameters. Within this method, a mathematical operation is performed on the first integer, and the second integer is displayed to the console.


**AbstractClassAssignment**

This repository contains a simple C# program that demonstrates the use of interfaces and polymorphism in an employee management system.
The program defines an interface called IQuittable with a method Quit(). The Employee class inherits from this interface and implements the Quit() method. The Quit() method in the Employee class can be customized to handle employee resignation in any desired way.


**OperatorsAssignment**

This repository contains a C# program that implements an Employee class for managing employee data.
The Employee class defined in this program includes properties for Id, FirstName, and LastName. Additionally, the == operator is overloaded to compare two Employee objects based on their Id property.


**CodeFirstAssignment**

This repository contains a basic console application built with Entity Framework Code-First to manage student data.
The program defines a Student class to represent the structure of a student entity, including properties such as Id, Name, and Age. It also includes a SchoolContext class which inherits from DbContext and provides a DbSet<Student> property for working with student entities.
